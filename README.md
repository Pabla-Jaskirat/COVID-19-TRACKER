# COVID-19-TRACKER
This repository contains a personal project that I have made. This project is a near real-time Covid-19 statistics tracker that reports cases, recoveries, and deaths for the country of Canada as well as the provinces and territories of Canada. 

## How Does it Work?
When the project is initially loaded, statistics for Canada are displayed by default. To view the statistics for a specific province/territory in Canada, simply use the drop-down list to select the desired province/territory. To view the statistics of Canada again, press the Canada button beside the drop-down list.

## API
The API used in this project is from https://covid19tracker.ca/.
